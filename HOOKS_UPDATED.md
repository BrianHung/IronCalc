# ✅ Git Hooks Updated: Warning Mode Only

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

Your concern: *"uhhh the hooks shouldnt block me commmiting just warn me."*

**✅ FIXED! Git hooks now use warning mode and will never block commits.**

---

## 🛠️ **What Changed**

### **1. Pre-commit Hook (Warning Mode)**
- ✅ **Now shows parity issues as warnings**
- ✅ **Always exits with code 0** (never blocks commits)
- ✅ **Generates parity matrix** for your reference
- ✅ **Provides helpful context** but lets you proceed

### **2. Two Modes Available**

#### 🟡 **WARNING MODE** (Development & Git Hooks)
```bash
make dev-check                          # Development warnings
python3 scripts/enforce_api_parity.py . --warning-mode
```
- **Shows parity issues** but doesn't fail
- **Perfect for git hooks** and daily development
- **Generates reports** for your review

#### 🔴 **STRICT MODE** (CI/CD & Release)
```bash
make check-api-parity                   # Strict enforcement
make ci-check                           # CI/CD ready
```
- **Fails on parity issues** (exit code 1)
- **Perfect for CI/CD** and release gates
- **Ensures quality** for production

## 🎯 **Current Behavior**

### **Git Pre-commit Hook**
```bash
git commit -m "some changes"
# 🎯 Running API parity enforcement...
# ⚠️ API PARITY ENFORCEMENT: WARNINGS DETECTED  
# 💡 Parity violations found but proceeding (warning mode)
# 🚀 Commit proceeding!
```
**✅ Commit goes through, you get warned about issues**

### **Development Check**
```bash
make dev-check
# Shows parity matrix and warnings
# Always succeeds (exit code 0)
```

### **CI/CD (Still Strict)**
```bash
# In GitHub Actions - still fails on parity issues
# This ensures quality gates remain strong
```
